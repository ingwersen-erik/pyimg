## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

To make it easier to other teammates to reproduce and identify the root-cause of the bug, try to answer the following questions, when filing an issue whenever applicable:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case, and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

**To identify the project version:**

To identify the package version you're using, enter your Python environment,
import the package and finally, access the `__version__` attribute from the package:

```console
$ python
Python 3.8.8 (default, Apr 13 2021, 12:59:45)
[Clang 10.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import pandas
>>> pandas.__version__
'1.3.5'
```

## How to request a feature

Request features on the [Issue Tracker].

Even if the project you're working on is not open-source, and there's a 99%
chance that you'll end up being the one in charge of developing the "new feature",
I would still advise you to create a new issue on the [Issue Tracker]. By mapping
the work to be done using the [Issue Tracker], others from your team will have
more visibility on what you're currently working on. This reduces the risk of
two people unknowingly working on the same issue. Additionally, you can link
project issues to commits, that might help you later on to categorize different
commits.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.7+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox]
- [nox-poetry]

### Install Poetry

If you don't have Poetry installed, please refer to the following
[guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), for instructions on how
to install it.

### Install _Pyimg_

Install the package with development requirements:

````{tab} Poetry
:new-set:
```console
$ poetry install
```
````

````{tab} Pip
```console
$ pip install -e .
```
````

### Run Interactive Session

You can now run an interactive Python session, or the command-line interface:

````{tab} Poetry
:new-set:
```console
$ poetry run python
$ poetry run pyimg
```
````

````{tab} Pip
```console
$ python
$ python pyimg
```
````

[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/

[nox-poetry]: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/) sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/) session. For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory, and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

[pytest]: https://pytest.readthedocs.io/

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/) test suite must pass **without errors and warnings.**
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, though—we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can
install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything. This will
allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
